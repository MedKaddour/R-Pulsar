# Rutgers-Pulsar
R-Pulsar is an IoT Edge Framework, that extends cloud capabilities to local devices and provides a programming model for deciding what, when, and where data get collected and processed. It has been deployed and tested on embedded devices (Raspberry Pi and Android phone) and presents an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that R-Pulsar can enable timely stream analytics by effectively leveraging edge and core resources.
